Title of the workshop: Internet of Things (IoT) in Healthcare Data Analytics (IoTHDA)

The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up significant opportunities for innovation in the healthcare sector. With the exponential growth of wearable devices and mobile health applications, a transformative shift is underway: moving from traditional, centralized healthcare delivery to personalized, IoT-enabled healthcare systems. The effective integration of IoT technologies in healthcare has the potential to enhance diagnosis and treatment efficiency, reduce costs, strengthen doctor-patient relationships, enable individualized care, and support sustainable health practices. Moreover, IoT-generated data is expanding rapidly, offering rich, complex, and diverse health-related information critical for personalized care and informed decision-making. These datasets not only represent large volumes of long-term health records but also capture valuable contextual information.
The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption and availability of IoT systems, driven by an urgent demand for remote healthcare solutions. This global health crisis catalyzed a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery: from institutional monitoring to patient-centered care provided at home. Consequently, the volume of IoT-generated healthcare data has grown exponentially.
Timely and effective analysts, visualization and exploration of complex multimodal healthcare data is essential for empowering individuals and healthcare providers with actionable insights and supporting smarter clinical decision-making. Emerging technologies in healthcare present new possibilities along with research challenges in complex multimodal and real time data analytics for personalized care and clinical decision support; exploring and advancing generative artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare service provisioning; and designing efficient standardized IoT system architectures with integrating evolving technology including wearable sensors. Addressing these issues is crucial for unlocking the potential of IoT-driven healthcare.
